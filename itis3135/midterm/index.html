            <p> Today I am going to teach about the sport of Hockey. I have been playing hockey for about 15 years. Hockey has given me so much like the ability to meet
                new people, travel around the country, and spend quality time with my family. It has also showed me how to work together with other people and to never
                give up.
            </p>

            <p>Im very thankful for what the game has given me. I can not wait to give you a basic run down of the amazing game called hockey.</p>

           <h2>About The Sport</h2>

           <div class = "ways">
            <p> To start there are 3 main ways people play hockey. The most popular way you will see it being played is one ice. You can also play it on a roller rink and in the 
              street. Today I will go through those three main ways of playing the game.
            </p> <br>
            <p>The first way I will explain it is when you play on an ice rink. Both teams would be made up of 18 players and 2 goalies. There are 12 forwards and 6 defenceman.
              Each team will have a group of 5 players on the ice along with one goalie at all times unless one team gets a penatly. If they get a penatly that player goes and sits
              in the penatly box for 2 minunites and their team plays down a guy for those two minutes. The game is over after you play 3 perioeds that are 20 minutes long with the
              clock stopping every time the whistle blows.
            </p><br>

            <p>Another way to play is on a roller hockey rink. The rules are basically the same expect each team usually has 8 players and 1 goalie. You play with 4 guys on the rink
              instead of 5. There is also no offisde or icing in roller hockey.The game is over after you play 3 perioeds that are 15 minutes long with the clock stopping every time
               the whistle blows.
            </p><br>
            
            <p>The final way most people play hockey is either in the street or in the drive way. For street hockey you just divide everyone up evenly and play until a certain  score.
              You will mainly see it being played while tail-gating for hockey games.
            </p>

        <h2>How To Start Playing Hockey</h2>
        
        <div id = "how">
          <p> The best way to start playing is to go to your local ice rink and ask if they have a learn to skate/learn to play. There they will teach you how to play the game.
            After you do that you will need to order the hockey gear

            <div class = "gear"> <p>The main gear you will need is:</p> </div>
            <ul>
              <li>Helmet</li>
              <li>Gloves</li>
              <li>Stick</li>
              <li>Skates</li>
              <li>Shin Pads</li>
              <li>Elbow Pads</li>
              <li>Shoulder Pads</li>
            </ul>
