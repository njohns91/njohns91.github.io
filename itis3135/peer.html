          <div class = "austin">
            <p>Overall Austin has a good webstie. There is a lot of detail and it visually looks great. There is just one thing that I think that needs to be chagned and
              that is the links at the bottom of the pages. They just look very squished. Also the links at the bottom of the home page dont look similar to the others at all.
            </p>

            <p>Crap:
              <ul>
                <li>Contrast: The colors choosen for this project contrast well off of eachother. It is not that hard to read anything.</li> 
                <li>Repetition:Everypage looks the same that is supposed to be.</li> 
                <li>Alignment: The alignment for the website looks good.</li>
                <li>Proximity: The Proximity of the website looks good. The only thing that needs to get fixed is the thing mentioned about about the links at the bottom of the page.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

               <div class = "nick">
                <p>Overall Nick website is decent looking it is hard to read in some spots and the text looks small.</p>
    
                <p>Crap:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: The colors choosen are okay. The black font with the blue background can make it hard to read a little bit..</li> 
                    <li>Repetition:Everypage the spoots that need to look the same do.</li> 
                    <li>Alignment: Some of the are not aligned with other things on the webpage. An example would be on the recording information page the first line looks like
                      it is tabed over.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: The proximity is good. Nothing looks like it is to close or to close together.</li>
                  </ul>
